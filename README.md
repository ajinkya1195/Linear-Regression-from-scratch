# Linear-Regression-from-scratch
Implemented a Linear Regression algorithm from scratch using NumPy to predict continuous values from multivariate data.  Designed and executed gradient descent logic manually, including custom loss calculation and weight updates. Visualized learning process and model performance using matplotlib plots for predictions and residuals.
